# Citizen Eyewear

I am creating a website for a fashion-forward opticians in the town of Maltwell, called Citizen Eyewear. The company are looking to update their image so need a new website that shows what facilities they offer, in addition to offering all the information that a customer would need in order to make an appointment.

The website acts as a front page for the physical store in the town, and will be able to offer patients and potential future patients insights into the business, services, pricing, and location.

## UX

This website is for anyone looking to book an eye test or buy eyewear in the area local to Maltwell. It is a 'front page' for the shop in the town. It will provide information about the shop and will include a form for people to fill to contact reception. It will also include some tips for patients on how often they should be seeing an optometrist and why.

With this in mind, it has to be easy to navigate - all adults should be able to use the website to access the information they need. That means that the UX will be straightfoward and should follow normal conventions.

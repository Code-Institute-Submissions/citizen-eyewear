# Citizen Eyewear

I am creating a website for a fashion-forward opticians in the town of Maltwell, called Citizen Eyewear. The company are looking to update their image so need a new website that shows what facilities they offer, in addition to offering all the information that a customer would need in order to make an appointment.

The website acts as a front page for the physical store in the town, and will be able to offer patients and potential future patients insights into the business, services, pricing, and location.

## UX

This website is for anyone looking to book an eye test or buy eyewear in the area local to Maltwell. It is a 'front page' for the shop in the town. It will provide information about the shop and will include a form for people to fill to contact reception. It will also include some tips for patients on how often they should be seeing an optometrist and why.

With this in mind, it has to be easy to navigate - the target audiences should be able to use the website to access the information they need. That means that the UX will be straightfoward and should follow normal conventions.

To acheive this in this project, I am using a framework, [Bootstrap 5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/), a toolkit that provides developers with a grid-based system, which is extremely adaptive with mobile-first design, as well as aiding with navigation and familiarity to the user using the basic components that can then be styled using CSS.

## User stories

The target audience for this webpage is an adult looking for information about a local eyewear shop.

These are some scenarios that a user may take when accessing the website:

#### A parent booking an eye test for their child
* I am a parent looking to book a first eye test for my child
* I want to find out who will be providing my child with the eye test
* I want information on where the premesis is
* I want contact details to call reception to book an eye test

#### A patient prior going to their eye test
* I am a patient looking for further information on the company before going for my eye test
* I want to find out more about the professionals that work there and who to contact in case I can't make my appointment
* I want to feel reassured about my appointment with the information I find on the webpage

#### A patient looking for a specific service (contact lenses)
* I am a patient looking for a service, i.e. contact lenses

## Features

### Existing Features (across all pages)
* Header - this is uniform across the site and houses the title/logo and the navbar
* Navbar - this allows users to navigate through the website easily
* Footer - this includes contact information that people would want access to (address/phone number) as well as some additonal links to social media

### Features Within Pages

#### Colours - background, text, borders

I have chosen the colours for the webpage with the help of an online tool, [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - I chose a main/base colour and generated a pallette of complementary colours. I have made the pallette simple, with only four colours, as I want to make sure the website looks sleek and not too busy with bright colours.

#### Fonts

I am using the font catalogue from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and, to choose fonts that work well together, [Font Pair](https://fontpair.co/), a typography website.

The fonts I have chosen are [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat).

#### Images
Images help to aid the user visually, so they are able to immediately identify the brand image, in this case, images on the Home page will be of glasses displays, and also images on the Team page of team members.

* I sourced my homepage images from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/) which is an image-hosting site providing free images for personal and commercial use
* My logo image was obtained from [Free Logo Design](https://www.freelogodesign.org/) - an online tool that can be used to create logos for personal and commercial use
* For the team page, I used [Generated Photos](https://generated.photos/), which uses AI generation to create a range of faces which are free to use for personal use

## Technologies Used 

* [Bootstrap 5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    * The project uses Bootstrap as a framework on which to build the webpage - the grid-based system is optimised for use on mobile and desktops so is ideal for continuity across different pages of the same website
* [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/)
    * CSS is used to provide styling for both original HTML features and additional styling to Bootstrap
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * An API that imports fonts that are more visually appealing than a browser's built-in fonts
* [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/#)
    * For the navbar, Hover.css is used to provide CSS3-powered responsive animation
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    * Font Awesome provides a library of fonts and icons, i.e. social media icons
